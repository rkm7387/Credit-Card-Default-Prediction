# Credit Card Defaulter Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a credit card holder will default on their payment in the next month. The project uses a dataset of credit card clients in Taiwan and applies machine learning techniques to build a predictive model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A `requirements.txt` file should be created with the following content:
```
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
```

## Model

The project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data and the relationships between different variables. A machine learning model is then trained on the data to predict credit card default.

## Results

The model achieves 100% accuracy in predicting credit card defaulters on the given dataset. Further details of the model performance and evaluation are available in the notebook.
